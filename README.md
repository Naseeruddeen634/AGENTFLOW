# AGENTFLOW
Autonomous AI agent that takes a plain-English goal, decomposes it into subtasks, selects and executes tools, evaluates results, and self-corrects on failure. Implements the ReAct (Reasoning + Acting) pattern with dynamic replanning. Built with LangChain, OpenAI GPT-4, and FastAPI. Dockerized.
